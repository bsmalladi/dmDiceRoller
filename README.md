## DMDice Roller

### Customizable dice roller for tabletop gaming, perfect for Game Masters and players alike

Have you ever wished you could automate complicated dice rolls, instead of having to roll multiple times and do all the math yourself?

The DMDice Roller allows users to create custom rolls, with modifiers included, so you can get the total at the push of a button and never
get sucked out of the game

This project is still under construction:
-Full deployed build coming in the near future
-Improved spacing and sizing on the way (yes, I know the sizing is really out of wack at the moment)
-Dice rolls based on DND character sheet input coming soon!

This project was built with React using create-react-app, with rudimentary styling using Bootstrap.
To run, install create-react-app, download source code, and enter 'npm start' at the command line in the root directory
